However, in addition to obligatory heritage conservation requirements,\n\t\t\t\t\tthere is no uniformity in historic dwellings\u2019 operation mode and conditioning\n\t\t\t\t\tequipment, which means detailed carbon emissions accounting is critical but\n\t\t\t\t\tchallenging. To estimate the spatio-temporal distribution of carbon emissions\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom historic dwellings and thus support the development of decarbonization\n\t\t\t\t\tretrofit strategies, this research proposed a low-interventional carbon\n\t\t\t\t\tfootprint accounting system based on a digital twin management platform.\n\t\t\t\t\tMultiple digital technologies are applied to monitor and evaluate the occupants\u2019\n\t\t\t\t\tlifestyles, indoor environment, user location, and equipment energy consumption.\n\t\t\t\t\tBased on backend algorithms, the spatio-temporal distribution of carbon\n\t\t\t\t\temissions is inserted into the building plan to graphically present the\n\t\t\t\t\tevaluation results. Compared with traditional simulation methods, the proposed\n\t\t\t\t\tsystem enables the automatic updating of energy accounting parameters by fusing\n\t\t\t\t\tmulti-source data into one platform, improving accounting efficiency and\n\t\t\t\t\taccuracy simultaneously. A case study in China proves the outstanding\n\t\t\t\t\tperformance of the accuracy of accounting results, with an approximate daily\n\t\t\t\t\tspatial error of 20 % and a total accounting error of less than 15 %."}}}

At the same time,\n\t\t\t\t\tdigitalization introduces new possibilities to leverage the untapped\n\t\t\t\t\toptimization potential to provide this flexibility. Mathematical optimization\n\t\t\t\t\tmethods such as mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) are widely used to\n\t\t\t\t\tpredict optimal operation plans for industrial systems. MILP models are\n\t\t\t\t\tdifficult to adapt, but the viability of the predicted plans relies on accurate\n\t\t\t\t\tunderlying models of the actual behavior. New automation paradigms, such as the\n\t\t\t\t\tdigital twin (DT), can overcome these current drawbacks. In this work, we\n\t\t\t\t\tpresent the implementation and experimental evaluation of several micro-services\n\t\t\t\t\ton a standardized five-dimensional DT platform that automate MILP model adaption\n\t\t\t\t\tand operation optimization. These micro-services guarantee that, (1) deviations\n\t\t\t\t\tbetween the physical entity and its virtual entity models are detected, (2) the\n\t\t\t\t\tmodels are adapted accordingly, (3) subsequently linearized to suit the MILP\n\t\t\t\t\tapproach and (4) used for live operational optimization. These novel services\n\t\t\t\t\tand DT workflows that orchestrate them were experimentally tested with a packed\n\t\t\t\t\tbed thermal energy storage (PBTES) test rig that acts as a physical entity. A\n\t\t\t\t\twaste heat recovery use case in steel production is used as the evaluation\n\t\t\t\t\tscenario. While the model error of a static simulation model would increase to\n\t\t\t\t\t60% over 7 days of operation, the model error remains well below 25% as a result\n\t\t\t\t\tof successful model adaption. The prediction error of the optimization model\n\t\t\t\t\tremains in a typical magnitude of 10 to 20% during the evaluation period,\n\t\t\t\t\tdespite the degradation of the PBTES power."}}}
