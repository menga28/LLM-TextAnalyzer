				<title>Evaluating carbon emissions from the operation of historic dwellings in
					cities based on an intelligent management platform</title>
				<abstract>Historic dwellings in cities are considered to be an important resource on
					the way to carbon neutrality because of their great potential for low-carbon
					renewal. However, in addition to obligatory heritage conservation requirements,
					there is no uniformity in historic dwellings’ operation mode and conditioning
					equipment, which means detailed carbon emissions accounting is critical but
					challenging. To estimate the spatio-temporal distribution of carbon emissions
					from historic dwellings and thus support the development of decarbonization
					retrofit strategies, this research proposed a low-interventional carbon
					footprint accounting system based on a digital twin management platform.
					Multiple digital technologies are applied to monitor and evaluate the occupants’
					lifestyles, indoor environment, user location, and equipment energy consumption.
					Based on backend algorithms, the spatio-temporal distribution of carbon
					emissions is inserted into the building plan to graphically present the
					evaluation results. Compared with traditional simulation methods, the proposed
					system enables the automatic updating of energy accounting parameters by fusing
					multi-source data into one platform, improving accounting efficiency and
					accuracy simultaneously. A case study in China proves the outstanding
					performance of the accuracy of accounting results, with an approximate daily
					spatial error of 20 % and a total accounting error of less than 15 %.</abstract>

				<title>A digital twin-based adaptive optimization approach applied to waste heat
					recovery in green steel production: Development and experimental investigation</title>
				<abstract>Renewable-dominated power grids will require industry to run their
					processes in accordance with the availability of energy. At the same time,
					digitalization introduces new possibilities to leverage the untapped
					optimization potential to provide this flexibility. Mathematical optimization
					methods such as mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) are widely used to
					predict optimal operation plans for industrial systems. MILP models are
					difficult to adapt, but the viability of the predicted plans relies on accurate
					underlying models of the actual behavior. New automation paradigms, such as the
					digital twin (DT), can overcome these current drawbacks. In this work, we
					present the implementation and experimental evaluation of several micro-services
					on a standardized five-dimensional DT platform that automate MILP model adaption
					and operation optimization. These micro-services guarantee that, (1) deviations
					between the physical entity and its virtual entity models are detected, (2) the
					models are adapted accordingly, (3) subsequently linearized to suit the MILP
					approach and (4) used for live operational optimization. These novel services
					and DT workflows that orchestrate them were experimentally tested with a packed
					bed thermal energy storage (PBTES) test rig that acts as a physical entity. A
					waste heat recovery use case in steel production is used as the evaluation
					scenario. While the model error of a static simulation model would increase to
					60% over 7 days of operation, the model error remains well below 25% as a result
					of successful model adaption. The prediction error of the optimization model
					remains in a typical magnitude of 10 to 20% during the evaluation period,
					despite the degradation of the PBTES power.</abstract>
